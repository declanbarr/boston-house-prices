### Project plan

Project is due on Friday 29th November 2019 which is 7 weeks from next Friday (written on Sunday 6th Oct 2019)

I will aim to have this completed 1 week in advance so this will give me 6 full weeks (not including this week). The aim will be to do 1 to 2 hours during the week and 2 or more at the weekend. This will enable me to balance the lessons from the new topics for this and the other modules as well as the assessments for the other modules.

I will aim to have all work, from introduction to conclusion finished by Friday 22nd November 2019. Time will be allocated based on marks available. From Friday 22nd until the due date extras can be added to enhance the project.

Breakdown of marks: Describe (20%), Infer (20%), Predict (60%)

Week 1 - Describe

Week 2 - Infer

Weeks 3,4 and 5 - Predict

Week 6 - Introduction, Conclusion, References, Tidy up and README

Week 7 - Extras or deeper analysis
