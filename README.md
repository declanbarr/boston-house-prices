### How to run the Jupyter Notebook

For this project I used Anaconda Custom Build py36h363777c_0 and Python version 3.6.9. Anaconda is a free and open source distribution of Python used for data science.[1] Anaconda provides a number of libraries that can be used for data analysis. For this project I will be using the following libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, Urllib, Sklearn, Keras.

The boston-house-prices-analysis.ipynb file can be viewed in full on GitHub or can be downloaded and run on your PC. To run on your own machine follow these steps:

1. Download the raw .ipynb file https://github.com/declanbarr/boston-house-prices/raw/master/boston-house-prices-analysis.ipynb
2. On the command line change directory into the directory where you saved the ipynb file
3. Start jupyter notebook by typing: jupyter notebook.
4. Please note that some of the neural net code sections may take a long time to run.

### Project plan (UPDATED)

New due date is Friday 13th December 2019. From today (Saturday 23rd November 2019) there are ~3 weeks remaining.

Describe, Infer and Predict are completed but these need to be expanded on and tidied up. Introduction, conclusion, references and README are yet to be completed.


Saturday 23rd Nov - Friday 29th Nov:
* Describe
* Infer
* Predict

Saturday 30th Nov - Friday 6th Dec:
* Introduction
* Conclusion 
* References
* README

Saturday 7th Dec - Friday 13th Dec:
* Additional Analyses



### Project plan (OLD)

Project is due on Friday 29th November 2019 which is 7 weeks from next Friday (written on Sunday 6th Oct 2019)

I will aim to have this completed 1 week in advance so this will give me 6 full weeks (not including this week). The aim will be to do 1 to 2 hours during the week and 2 or more at the weekend. This will enable me to balance the lessons from the new topics for this and the other modules as well as the assessments for the other modules.

I will aim to have all work, from introduction to conclusion finished by Friday 22nd November 2019. Time will be allocated based on marks available. From Friday 22nd until the due date extras can be added to enhance the project.

Breakdown of marks: Describe (20%), Infer (20%), Predict (60%)

Week 1 - Describe

Week 2 - Infer

Weeks 3,4 and 5 - Predict

Week 6 - Introduction, Conclusion, References, Tidy up and README

Week 7 - Extras or deeper analysis
