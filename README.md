### How to run the Jupyter Notebook

For this project I used Anaconda Custom Build py36h363777c_0 and Python version 3.6.9. Anaconda is a free and open source distribution of Python used for data science.[1] Anaconda provides a number of libraries that can be used for data analysis. For this project I will be using the following libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, Urllib, Sklearn, Keras.

The boston-house-prices-analysis.ipynb file can be viewed in full on GitHub or can be downloaded and run on your PC. To run on your own machine follow these steps:

1. Download the raw .ipynb file https://github.com/declanbarr/boston-house-prices/raw/master/boston-house-prices-analysis.ipynb
2. On the command line change directory into the directory where you saved the ipynb file
3. Start jupyter notebook by typing: jupyter notebook.
4. Please note that some of the neural net code sections may take a long time to run.
